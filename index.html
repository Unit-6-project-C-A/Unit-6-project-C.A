        <p id = "para1">It is not only to help the pets on our website find their forever homes but also to help people find their best friends. Our mission is to ensure that these pets are not only going to a wonderful home but also know that they are being well taken care of. When you adopt a pet from a rescue organization, you are not only giving a loving home to an animal in need, but you are also supporting a cause that helps reduce animal overpopulation. Giving a chance to an animal in need you are not only changing their life but they are also changing yours.</p>
        <h1 id = "wa">WHY ADOPT..</h1>
        <p id = "para2">When you adopt a pet you are also saving  a beautiful furry friend’s life. Studies show that when a pet comes in your life you they are not only  reducing stress and anxiety, but they are also  improving your mood, and lowering blood pressure.You are also saving a good amount of money when you adopt. With the small fee they charge you don’t have to worry about their medical care because most of the time they are up to date with all their vaccines, spayed/nutered.</p>
